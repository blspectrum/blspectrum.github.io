"The Boyfriend" on netflix became a hit in multiple countries, bringing a new wave in Japan's dating reality show. 
The program captures the love and friendships between the boys who spends the summer operating a coffee truck.  
With beautiful scenaries and summer vibe songs, the content is made to be like a movie full of memories.

<strong>What to expect</strong>
One thing viewers can expect is the variety of shape of love. 
One-sided love, mutal crushes, and even an love triangle appears in the show. 
Their feelings and relationships changes along time and many events awaiting for them. 
Especially, the love story of Shun, an artist who grew up in the orphanage, draws attention in the show. 
The show is not only a love story but also a human documentary, showcasing the boys' growth influenced by each other's thinking and actions. 

<strong>Which Episodes?</strong>
There are several hot moments throughout the show including heartfluttering moments and heat up moments.
Everyone will agree the end of the episode 8 is wonderful (I am not going to further comment on this, check it out yourself!)
I also would like to recommend the first episode as it shows how bright and beautiful the vibes are. 
It gives of the shy encounter and the observation between each other. If you have watched the show already, I suggest you to watch it again! 
You get to see how the arrows of the boys point at each other and how it changes through the show <3
